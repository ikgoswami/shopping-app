Create a small shopping app:

1. Create a simple splash screen with any dummy image.
2. Create a login page where just entering any valid email should give success.
3. Create a home page with some dummy banners images. Banners will be a vertical list of 25 banners.
4. Each banner click should be taken to a static product list. You can store the product list in the codebase itself.
5. Clicking on any product should open a product detail page where you need to show product image and product name and price and a buy now button.
6. Clicking on the buy now button should take to the cart page. You should be able to add multiple products to the cart and you can store the cart list locally. You need to show the total amount of cart and list of cart items. Each item in the list should show the image name and price.
7. Clicking on the place order button should remove local cart items and should display a notification of the success order.
